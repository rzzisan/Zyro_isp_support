"""Billing's Expire Date (BillingLastDate, a day of the month) moved to the day the customer paid, after the line was
off for a while and a (nearly) full bill turned it back on. Zisan's rule (2026-10-28):

  * the line was disabled for at least expire_min_off_hours (24) and then enabled again;
  * a receipt between the disable day and the day after the enable paid at least expire_min_paid_pct (85) percent of
    its payable (paid + discount, any source: Desk, billing's Daily Bill, online gateway);
  * the new day is that receipt's Bangladesh date, at most expire_max_day (28).
  * Only for the one-time bulk list: Home customers get 5 days more when they paid on or before the 20th, up to the
    20th (paid on the 21st or later: the pay day).

bulk: the "মেয়াদ বদল" page builds the list (preview; the owner ticks customers off = skipped) and runs it (queued ->
done/failed). auto: the hourly timer (zyro-expire-date.timer, only while billing_connections.expire_auto is on) looks
at customers paid in the last three days, re-reads their line log and receipts from billing, and sets the day.

Writing goes through the customer edit form (ISPDigital.set_expire_day): every other field is sent back as billing
showed it, "Mikrotik Impact" off. After each write the change log is read back; anything but ExpireDate changing stops
the whole run. Each row keeps the day it replaced (rollback).
